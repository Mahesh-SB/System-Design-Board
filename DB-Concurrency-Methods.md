# System Design: Concurrency Control in Distributed Systems
Concurrency control is essential in distributed systems to maintain data integrity, consistency, and user trust. The choice of mechanism depends on system characteristics, like read/write ratio, consistency level, and fault tolerance needs.

### üöÄ Why Concurrency Control?
In distributed systems, multiple users or services often access and modify shared data concurrently across different nodes. Without proper control, this can lead to:
1. Lost updates
2. Dirty reads
3. Inconsistent data states
4. Violations of ACID/BASE properties
Concurrency Control ensures correct and consistent execution of transactions ‚Äî even when they span across multiple nodes.

### üîë Key Goals
1. Maintain consistency
2. Preserve isolation
3. Avoid conflicts (write-write, read-write)
4. Ensure serializability ‚Äî transactions appear to run one after another

# Optimistic Concurrency Control Methods
Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) uses validation-based approaches to ensure data consistency without using locks. There are three main OCC methods based on how the system validates transactions before committing:


## üß† 1. Timestamp Ordering Method
Each transaction gets a unique timestamp when it starts.

Reads and writes are compared against other transactions‚Äô timestamps.

A transaction is aborted if it tries to read or write stale data (i.e., data modified by a newer transaction).

üìå Example:
T1 (timestamp = 10) reads X.
T2 (timestamp = 20) updates X.
T1 tries to commit ‚Üí fails, because X was changed by a newer transaction.


## üß™ 2. Validation-Based Method (also called "Three-Phase Validation")
This is the classic OCC algorithm, with three phases:
üîπ a) Read Phase:
The transaction reads and works on local copies (no updates to the database yet).
üîπ b) Validation Phase:
The system checks if the data read by the transaction has been modified by others since the read began.
üîπ c) Write Phase:
If validation succeeds, changes are written to the database.
Otherwise, the transaction is rolled back.

### üìå Validation Rules:
Let T·µ¢ be the current transaction and T‚±º be any other transaction that committed before T·µ¢‚Äôs validation:
If T‚±º finished before T·µ¢ started, no conflict.
If T‚±º and T·µ¢ overlapped, T‚±º must not have written to any data that T·µ¢ read.


## üîÅ 3. Version-Based Method (Multiversion OCC)
This method uses multiple versions of a data item, each tagged with a timestamp/version.
Transactions read a consistent snapshot (like Snapshot Isolation).
Writes create a new version.
Validation ensures no conflicting writes occurred since the read.

üìå Used in:
1. PostgreSQL
2. Oracle
3. MVCC databases

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Timestamp Ordering   | Uses timestamps to order events     | Simple and deterministic              | Can lead to many aborts        |
| Validation-Based     | Validates before committing         | Avoids unnecessary locking            | Costly validation phase        |
| Version-Based (MVCC) | Uses versions to maintain snapshots | Great for read-heavy, low-conflict DB | Needs more storage and cleanup |



# üîê Pessimistic Concurrency Control Methods


## 1. Shared Lock / Read Lock (S-Lock)
A Shared Lock (S-Lock) allows multiple transactions to read a resource but not modify it. However, no transaction can write to it until all shared locks are released.

### SQL Example Using SELECT ... WITH (HOLDLOCK, ROWLOCK) in SQL Server

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Transaction 1
SELECT * 
FROM Employees WITH (HOLDLOCK, ROWLOCK)
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

-- HOLDLOCK is like a shared lock held until the transaction completes
-- ROWLOCK ensures row-level locking

-- Wait here and do not commit yet
-- Simulate a delay
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10';

COMMIT;

```
At the same time, if another transaction tries to write to that row:

```
-- Transaction 2 (running in parallel)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 60000
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

COMMIT;

```
üîÑ What happens?
The UPDATE in Transaction 2 will block until Transaction 1 commits.
This is because the shared lock from Transaction 1 blocks exclusive locks required by Transaction 2.


## 2. Write Lock / Exclusive Lock (X-Lock)

An Exclusive Lock (X-Lock) prevents any other transaction from reading or writing the locked resource until the lock is released (i.e., the transaction is committed or rolled back). It is typically used during UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT.

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Transaction 1: Acquire an exclusive lock on the row
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 75000
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

-- This locks the row exclusively until COMMIT
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10';  -- Simulate a long transaction

COMMIT;

```
üß† During this time:
```
-- Transaction 2 (better example): This will BLOCK until X-lock is released
SELECT * 
FROM Employees WITH (HOLDLOCK)
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

```


## 3. Two-Phase Locking Protocol (2PL)

### how can start releasing lock in Two-Phase Locking(2PL) ?
Two-Phase Locking (2PL) can start releasing locks in the shrinking phase, while still running ‚Äî something that is not allowed in Strict 2PL.


### 2PL in Action
Suppose we have two data items: A and B.
Transaction T1 wants to:
1. Read and write A
2. Commit the result
3. Then later read B
4. Locking Allowed

Time | Action by T1          | Locking Phase        | Notes
-----|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------
 T1  | Acquire X-lock on A   | Growing Phase        | Lock acquired for writing A
 T2  | Write A               | Growing Phase        | Still acquiring locks
 T3  | Release X-lock on A   | Shrinking Phase üß®  | Starts shrinking phase
 T4  | Try to Acquire lock B | ‚ùå Not Allowed      | Violates 2PL (cannot acquire after releasing)

###  In SQL (2PL-like behavior) 
```
-- Pseudocode for Transaction T1
BEGIN;

-- Growing phase
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE; -- Lock A

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;

-- Now releasing lock on A (shrinking phase starts)
COMMIT;  -- Imagine this commit just applies changes to A and doesn't end transaction

-- Later try to lock B (invalid in 2PL)
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE id = 2 FOR UPDATE; -- ‚ùå Not allowed in 2PL now
```

#### What happens with Update after the commit ?
The second UPDATE will either:
Run as an implicit new transaction (in some DBs like MySQL autocommit mode), or
Fail or throw an error if the DB requires explicit transactions





## how can start releasing lock in Strict Two-Phase Locking(2PL) ?
Strict Two-Phase Locking is a special case of 2PL.
üîí All locks are held until the transaction COMMITs or ABORTs ‚Äî even if the transaction is "done" with the data.


### Strict 2PL in Action
Suppose T1 wants to:
1. Read and update data item A
2. Read and update data item B

Commit
Time | Action by T1                | Phase           | Lock State
-----|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------
 T1  | Acquire X-lock on A         | Growing         | Lock A acquired
 T2  | Update A                    | Growing         | A is still locked
 T3  | Acquire X-lock on B         | Growing         | Lock B acquired
 T4  | Update B                    | Growing         | B is still locked
 T5  | COMMIT                      | End of Tx       | üîì Locks A & B released together


###  In SQL (Strict 2PL-like behavior) 
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Locks A for writing
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- Locks B for writing
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

-- Locks are still held here
COMMIT;  -- üîì All locks released now
```
